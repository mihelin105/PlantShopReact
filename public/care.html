        <h2>Light</h2>
        <p>
          Light is one of the most important things your plant needs—but not all
          plants soak up the sun the same way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some houseplants thrive in bright, direct light (think sunny
          windowsills), while others prefer softer, indirect light or even
          low-light corners. A good rule of thumb: leafy tropical plants usually
          love medium to bright indirect light, while desert plants like
          succulents crave direct sunlight.
        </p>

        <p>
          Fun Fact: Did you know plants can actually get sunburned? If you
          notice crispy brown edges, your plant might be getting too much direct
          sun! When in doubt, rotate your plant every week or two so all sides
          get some sun love. This helps it grow evenly and prevents that
          “leaning toward the window” look.
        </p>
        <p>
          Plants also have their preferences when it comes to direction.
          South-facing windows tend to get the most intense sunlight, while
          east-facing windows provide gentle morning light, which is perfect for
          more delicate species. West-facing windows offer warmer afternoon sun,
          and north-facing ones usually give the least light — ideal for
          low-light lovers like ZZ Plants or Snake Plants.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pro Tip: If you’re unsure how much light a spot gets, try the shadow
          test. Place your hand between the window and the surface — a sharp,
          clear shadow means bright light, a soft blurry one means medium light,
          and no shadow means low light.
        </p>
        <p>
          If natural light is limited in your space, don’t worry — grow lights
          are a great alternative. They mimic the sun and keep your plants
          thriving even in darker corners or during gloomy winter months. Plus,
          they come in cute, modern styles that blend right in with your decor.
          No matter where you live or how much sunlight your space gets, there’s
          a plant that will feel right at home.

        <h2>Watering</h2>
        <p>
          Water is life—for both you and your plant. But when it comes to
          houseplants, it’s all about balance. Overwatering is the #1 plant
          killer, so always check the soil before you pour. Stick your finger
          about an inch deep—if it feels dry, it’s time to water. If it’s still
          moist, wait a little longer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Different plants have different thirst levels. Tropical plants like
          ferns and calatheas enjoy consistently damp soil, while succulents and
          cacti prefer their soil to dry out completely between drinks. Hack
          alert: Want to avoid overwatering and make sure your plant gets just
          what it needs? Try bottom watering. Simply place your plant pot (with
          drainage holes) in a bowl of water and let it sit for about 20
          minutes. The soil will soak up just the right amount of water from the
          bottom up—no soggy roots, no stress!
        </p>
        <p>
          Every plant has its rhythm, and it’s totally okay if you don’t get it
          right the first time. Keep an eye on your plant’s leaves—they’re great
          communicators. Wilting, yellowing, or soft stems are often signs of
          too much water, while crispy edges and drooping leaves can mean it’s
          too dry.
        </p>
        <p>
          Water quality matters too! If your tap water is heavily treated or
          high in minerals, it might cause leaf browning over time. If you
          notice that happening, try using filtered or rainwater—it’s gentler
          and more natural for most houseplants.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fun Fact: Many plants actually prefer a humid environment over
          frequent watering. Misting, grouping plants together, or placing a
          water tray nearby can create a mini tropical vibe—especially helpful
          for ferns, calatheas, and other humidity lovers. At the end of the
          day, watering is less about following strict rules and more about
          building a routine and paying attention. Your plant will tell you what
          it needs—you just have to listen.

        <h2>Nutritions</h2>
        <p>
          Absolutely! Here's a well-rounded and friendly "Nutrition for Plants"
          section you can use for your website — written to match the tone of
          your existing content: Nutrition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just like us, plants need more than water and sunshine to truly
          thrive—they need a balanced diet of nutrients to grow strong, stay
          green, and fight off stress. The three main nutrients in plant food
          are: Nitrogen (N): Helps plants grow lush, green leaves. Perfect for
          foliage-focused plants. Phosphorus (P): Supports strong root
          development and encourages flowering and fruiting. Potassium (K):
          Boosts overall health and helps regulate water within the plant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Together, they’re known as N-P-K, and you’ll often see those letters
          on fertilizer labels. Think of them as your plant’s essential
          vitamins! But that’s not all—plants also love a few micronutrients
          like calcium, magnesium, and iron. These might sound small, but they
          play a big role in everything from chlorophyll production to cell
          strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fun Fact: Indoor plants don’t get a steady flow of nutrients like they
          would in the wild. That’s why it’s helpful to give them a little boost
          every few weeks during the growing season (spring and summer).
        </p>
        <p>
          Pro Tip: Go easy on the fertilizer—too much can burn roots and do more
          harm than good. When in doubt, dilute your liquid plant food to half
          strength. With the right nutrients, your plants will grow happier,
          healthier, and greener—inside and out! Let me know if you want a
          simplified version (like for kids or beginners), or if you want this
          split into visuals or tip cards!
